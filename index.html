  <h1 class="anim-typewriter">WELCOME TO GUESS THE EMOJI</h1>
  <p>Inspired by Hues And Cues, Guess The Emoji is a board game developed to document words used by players to describe emojis. 
  It was created as an effort to help Stanford University’s SILLICON Unicode initiative in creating a more cultural and linguistic inclusive digital space for disadvantaged languages. 
  </p>

  <h2>BEFORE PLAYING</h2>
  <p>Note from the Developer: The Guess The Emoji team currently has a sinlge developer (Ms.D). She is working hard to learn back-end development to make Guess The Emoji 
  a functional multiplayer game...but she is alas limited by the amount of time available in a day. In the meantime, the game's structure and rules are modified. 
  Learn more below! 
  </p>

  <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
  <p>If playing in a 4+ player group, you can form 2-3 player teams, although this is not necessary! 
    Players can play individually if desired. 
  </p>

  <p>The Manager will click any emoji 18 times (yes, i know, but just bare with me haha), 
    making all 6 colored chips available.
